welcome to bop it!
bop it is a reaction game toy where you need to folow the commands of a speaker.
the commands are as follows:
bop it: press the button in the center of the toy, computer key is spacebar
twist it: twist the circle twistable crank, the computer key is enter.
pull it: pull the pullable handle on the toy, the computer key is tab
when you turn bop it on, it says bop it to start.
after you bop it, it plays a beet, and then gives a command. you must reply to this command quickly.
try out how quickly you need to make the correct movement by losing. if you lose in a first game, you will know how fast you will have to react.
if you beet the level by making 100 correct movements, you will get to expert level. try to correctly react to sound commands. a drum sound meens bop it, a scratching sound meens twist it, a whistle sound is pull it!
if you beet this level, you will be taken to the last level, master. master level is random mixing of voice and sound commands.
for example it can say: bop it, pull it, whistle sound, drum sound, twist it, drum sound, whistle sound, twist it...
if you manage to beet this level, you will beet bop it.
when bop it says bop it to start, you can pull it to change whether you want to play solo or pass it. about pass it mode in the next chapter.
also you can twist it to change your level: novice, expert and master, if you unlocked them.
in original game, twist it changes the volume, and the level button changes the level. and also the master level in bop it toy is mixing of voice, sounds and color commands. but i didn't create the color level because i am blind, and i don't know what command is what color. instead of bop it, twist it or pull it, it could say yellow, white and blue.

pass it mode
in this mode you play with other players. when the game  says pass it, you need to give the game to another person.
there are no limitation of players in pass it. if someone lost, he is illiminated from the game! the last one wins.

console commands:
to reset your bop it scores and unlocked levels, open console and write bopitreset
to open this help file again, tipe bopithelp
enjoy bopping, twisting and pulling. but don't break the game if you are angry! ahahaha!
