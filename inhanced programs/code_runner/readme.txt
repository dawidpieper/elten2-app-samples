code runner is a good tool to run ruby code from some places of elten without copying and pasting.
how to use
open code runner program in elten programs menu.
there will be list of your notes. if you have code in some notes, you can press on a note and run code from there
to add a note with some code: go to notes in community menu
then press ctrl+n
type the name of the code, for example "play some sounds and speak hello"
then press tab, and type some ruby code there, for example:
play("feed_update")
alert("hello!")
NVDA.braille("hello!")after you write the code, press tab key and press on create button.
then open code runner at any time, and press on the note you want to run.

context menu
to open context menu, press alt or context menu hotkey, press up and down arrows to navigate
options:
run code from clipboard: runs some code from clipboard
run some code at startup of elten: runs a code when elten starts! this doesn't work properly, so don't write code that plays sounds, or speaks. just write some code to change some settings on elten startup, or get some information from files.
